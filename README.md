Virtual_Machine_Simulator
=========================

Course Programming Project: virtual machine simulator in C.

Created in the Fall Semester of my Sophomore year 2013.

All files were given for the assignment however almost the entirety of LC4.c, ObjectFiles.c, and trace.c and some functions in LC4.h were written by myself.

The simulation effectively simulates the object instruction executions of the machine as if the machine existed and updates it as it changed.  The code reads and parses the input object files and loads the information into the simulated machine.  After the simulation, the output is a .trace file of the exectured instructions.
