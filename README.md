Virtual_Machine_Simulator
=========================

Course Programming Project: virtual machine simulator.

All files were given for the assignment however almost the entirety of LC4.c, ObjectFiles.c, and trace.c and some functions in LC4.h were written by myself.

The simulation effectively simulates the instructions of the machine as if the machine existed and updates it as it changed.  The code reads and parses the object files given to it and loads the information into the simulated machine.  After the simulation, the output is the assembly version of the virtually loaded object file.
